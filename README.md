# Computer games 1988 - 2016

## A shiny app presenting key stats and visualisations from computer games dataset produced by Lauren Davidson in January 2020 as a weekend project.

The app takes the computer games data provided by CodeClan and presents key information about the sales and ratings of computer games over time.

The app:

* cleans the data
* extracts key statistics
* visualises sales figures for computer games over time
* visualises a score made up of player and critic ratings for computer games over time
* allows users to adjust the above visualisations to show specific genres, platforms and publishers
